Talked about models right before and came up with questions for them
Showed client wireframes using adobe xd
They clicked through and gave their opinions
For the volunteer side
Seemed like it was easy for them to learn
Though, they do have a lot of experience
They liked how the pages looked
Overall was positive
Staff side
Presented our shortcuts (condensing certain items to one page, like substitutions)
Liked the substitutions being all on one page (keeps them from forgetting)
Also liked how the customer edit page showed up straight after clicking on their names
Questions
Right now looks like sub requests just go through unless under 48 hours in advance
The pages that seem like they just go to a text field are creating the rows in the pets tables
Number of dogs and number of cats would be easier
For pets, you may need to further specify type (small, large, …)
Said they were fine with communicating that manually
Packer jobs - 2 cold, 3 hot
They said they don’t see new jobs ever being needed
Biweekly and monthly routes are possibilities
They have a number for the week as the way to put these in
1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, last 
Customers can be on routes with different recurrences
MoWedFri, TueThu, daily, …
Customers are on a weekly schedule
They can cancel their deliveries for days, ranges of days, for the foreseeable future, 
They call in to do this
Will need meal recurrences and route recurrences
Currently subs cannot request subs
Want subs to be able to back out of substitutions (free it back up)
Don’t care about chain of subs, just who was supposed to do the route and who ended up doing it
Everyone who recurs on a route should show up for route info as a typical volunteer
Weekend meals are divided into saturday and sunday
They are delivered on Fridays
Volunteers need to see number of meals if applicable
This means that friday routes can be much bigger
Current UI has some features that staff don’t use/don’t know how to use

Nate’s Notes:
- requests don't have to be approved (can't do it within 48 hrs)
- # of dogs/# of cats vs pet table (wet/dry or either)
- 3 current shuttle routes (might increase) only one dropoff location (stretch goal: add address)
- get rid of packer supervisor
- 2 cold and 3 hot jobs per day (all at once) (1 hot and 1 cold is a meal together)
- weekly/biweekly/monthly routes exist
- 1st/2nd/3rd/4th/5th week
- once a week; 5 days plus weekend; 5 days no weekend (varied)
- delete substitute request; go back to needing a route
- just need to know who is supposed to do route and who is actually doing it
- "that's not your route, e.g. it's the 2nd thursday and you're requesting the 3rd thursday"
- no deliveries on weekends (only deliver Mon - Fri)
- no biweekly meal deliveries (only biweekly route driving)
- customers can go on hold (indefinitely and cancel for specific days) --  call in
- weekend meals only go out on Fridays
- labels get printed a day before; weekend meals get printed Friday
- announcement: closed for snow (or NOT closed for snow)
- open route request: volunteer named "open route"
	- can create substitution request for open route
	- don't do this automatically

Take out numweekendmeals; add numvolunteersrequired

Routes are only delivered when volunteers are assigned to them
It seems that route day of the week is not stored on the route
Instead, OpenRoute is used as a “placeholder” volunteer to substitute
On days where the route is not needed to be delivered upon, null is used
