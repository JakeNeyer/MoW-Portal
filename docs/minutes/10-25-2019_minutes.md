- Asked about open route and how we will merge the jobs all together on one page
- Only have open route if the route is actually supposed to happen
- A route not going out is represented by a lack of a driver
- Set-up a recurrence for routes/shuttles - this could get rid of a lot of open route stuff--- MoWeFri or every day
- Asked about the way recurrences should get entered in to the create customer page
- They said they liked the way it gets added now, but would like to add single days too, not just cancel
- Talked about hosting with AWS -- they have services for nonprofits
- Will send them details
