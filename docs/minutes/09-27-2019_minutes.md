We drafted up user stories and sent them over the day before.

They made some notes on the document and gave us some desired info 
Emphasized daily functioning portal is necessary
Shoutout Rick

* Make sure that the data they still want is transferred over
* Want to be able to edit and view from the same page
* Add waitlist thing to the notes
* Can’t be active and on the waitlist

I think maybe just a search bar with names would be nice 

They said they wouldn’t need to override waitlist position but we should add it (could lead to frustrations down the line)
