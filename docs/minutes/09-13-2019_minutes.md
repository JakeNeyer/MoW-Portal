- ssh -p 22107 cpteam7@128.143.67.97 
- Current setup = volunteers and admin have logins, clients do not
- Admin takes a large portion of responsibility because clients may not do it themselves (for various reasons)
- “Code is not efficient enough for the amount of data being put in”
- Past capstone team said we should probably just re-write it
- They export everything to excel because they are scared of data being lost
- Currently paying small monthly fee for hosting
- ~300 volunteers, 4 staff
-  Some volunteers work weekly, some only 2-3 days a year
- Said that deleting users doesn’t actually delete them?
- Volunteers do not have access to client info or other volunteer info
- Roughly 200 clients, can activate and deactivate them
- No ability to see what happened in the past
- Is this deleted or just not accessible?
- Sometimes changes are not reflected for meal cancellations
- I would assume it's because meals are counted in the morning
- “Whiteboard” is not needed
- Mass emailing would be nice to have
- Send these to daily volunteer
- “Querying could be improved”
- Forgot password feature not working
- Login is username and password
- Firstname_lastname
- Need day to day snapshot of what’s going on
- Who’s volunteering and who’s getting meals
- Labels for food is printed out
- Daily count sheet is for billing contractors
- Daily driver report
- Route management
- Volunteer needs to see route, be able to request a substitute, can sign up for another route
- Portal needs to support addition and deletion of routes
- Currently is not very user friendly
- Some people print out the maps
- Site should support phone use
- Want to know how many substitutes per day, new volunteers added
- Employees report to the board of directors

- I think we should try to add a feature where you can create new reports; their desired reports may change over time

Kev’s notes ^ some are redundant

Issues/Goals
Margins/labels with reports
Ability to use Google Maps for driving directions → phone
Ability to print Google Maps → laptop
Smaller map size on website
Reduce # of clicks
Reduce # of pages
Show everyone who gets meals on specific day of the week
Record-keeping:
1 year for reports
1-3 months for day-to-day activities
Easily  maintainable 

Stats:
Clients = 75% retired
