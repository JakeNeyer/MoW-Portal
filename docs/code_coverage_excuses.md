Our team achieved 96% code coverage, but there remain a few edge cases (mostly in our views files) that remain uncovered. Ultimately, we prioritized finishing the features that our customer desired and testing critical components of our application over testing each edge case. Our application is quite large with over 5,000 lines of testable code, making it difficult to achieve perfect 100% coverage. For example, we have several conditions in our application that return errors for data malformed in a specific way, or for incorrect HTTP request types, and we do not test these checks each time.
